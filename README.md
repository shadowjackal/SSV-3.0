To use this project, drag this into your Jo engine enviroment. 

controls for the converter GUI are as follows : 
    Q and E to traverse frames (animated SSV's only),
    J and K to rotate face directions, 
    U and I to flip horizontally and vertically the faces, 
    1,2,3,4 keys all are for setting the "pinching point" of Quad-trangles, basically triangles made from a quad. this is necessary because otherwise itll display bad.
    Most importantly CTRL + S to save your SSV. make sure it ideally has a 2-4 Letter name and is in all CAPS , for example SNC.SSV or TEST.SSV.
